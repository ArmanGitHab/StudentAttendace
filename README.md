## Features

- Add new student records
- Mark attendance for students
- Update attendance records
- Generate attendance reports
- User-friendly interface with logical flow

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Core programming language)
- **PostgreSQL** (Database management system)
- **psycopg2** (Python-PostgreSQL database adapter)
- **Pandas** (For data analysis, if required)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
